## Code, templates, exercises, essays and assignments for York U CSML1020 Machine Learning At Scale, Fall2019

In this course, we learned to use cloud-based GPUs to train models with WAY more data than our own computers could possibly handle. The mandate was to "play with models in the cloud". I chose audio data, because I had never worked with it before, which seemed even more playful. I was able to train a model that could accurately identify British birds by their songs. I was able to deploy models in web browser, so that birds could theoretically be identified with a smartphone in the field. Between the lack of Canadian birds in my dataset, and issues with pre-processing audio that I didn't have time to catch up with during the course, I was unable to deploy the final solution. I got a very good mark in the course anyway, just for the machine learning part.

One of many, many things I enjoyed about this course was that I overcame my aversion to using LaTeX templates, see .pdf file for how that worked out!
